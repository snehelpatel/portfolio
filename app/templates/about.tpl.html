        <p>I'm Snehel, a frontend developer in Atlanta, Georgia, who aims to creative intuitive, streamlined, and visually pleasing apps.</p>
          <p>In a prior life I went to law school, wrote grants as an AmeriCorps VISTA, taught disinterested farmer's market crowds about food insecurity, and organized dances for socially isolated senior citizens.
            <p>My current interests include anxiously watching Atlanta develop, knitting greyhound pajamas, practicing mindfulness, and writing cleaner code.</p>
